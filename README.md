# Promote free shipping

Show a customer how much is left until he/she benefits from a free shipping discount

## Intended use

A shop offers free shipping once the cart subtotal reaches a certain amount (ie. with a cart promotion rule). The shop owner wants to display the difference between the current subtotal and the configured free shipping amount to promote the free shipping and encourage customers to purchase more.
